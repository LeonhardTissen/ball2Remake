I am happy to announce that I've released a new game! 📣

Ball 2 Remake is a pixel perfect recreation of a really old computer game from my childhood (Released ~2000).

It was nearly impossible to find, but with the help of a friend and the WaybackMachine, I got hold of the original .exe file.

I took it upon myself to rewrite the game in JavaScript to allow more people to play it and for me to be able to add things to it.

So in less than 3 days, I created:
- A 1:1 recreation of the platformer 👾
- A level editor with the ability to upload and share levels ⚒️
- A smoother experience than the original provided 🫠

Go play the 30+ levels, but be warned... it's quite difficult 😉
